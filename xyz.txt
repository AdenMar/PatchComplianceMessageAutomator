Get Well - Offline Systems [Action Required]

Good Morning!

We noticed that a couple of your systems appear to be offline. 

If still in use, please boot these systems so we can ensure they are up to date:
	HERB-PC, last user hperson, last logon today
	[system name], last user [username], last logon [logon time]

If no longer in use, please let us know instead so we may act accordingly.

Thank you,
Aden and Kristin

Good Morning!

Please let us know a good time to schedule a reboot for these systems:

It is important to keep these systems up to date to minimize security risk and ensure your computers run as effectively as possible.
